# What? <A name="toc1-0" title="What?" />


This is a library that if you load it into a webpage just ruins it subtly and drives the user nuts. It's awful and you shouldn't use it.

If you want to help make this joke of a horrible thing even more funny and terrible, then go ahead. Edit stuff in. I'll merge any not completely off-base pull request.

Nobody is using this in production one hopes, so we're not too worried about breaking it.
